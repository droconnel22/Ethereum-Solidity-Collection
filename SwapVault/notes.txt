Bilateral

Two parties

CME

Swap market is a market bilateral agreements

Dealer:

Client:

Dealer vs Dealer

Dealer as a counterparty the swap market has an implicity risk inline with bank risk / counterparty risk

Single A rating

Swap curves, yields, treasury market there is yield ranks somewhere in line with the single A corporate credit yields

not exactly the same

financal vs corporate risk

How is it traded through different products or instruments

front end of the yield curve, 2/3 years out

Eurodollar futures, primary means to trade 

Essentially the expecations of the future swap rate

Beyond 3+ years the futures market is not as liquid use Swaps

Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) (Vanilla IRS)

Nothing more exchanging payment

agreeds to fixed 

agreeds to pay float

all sorts of swaps float vs float | fixed vs fixed | muniswaps

Vanilla IRS:

Fixed vs. float

The expectation is that interest will increase and the dealer with hedge that

Client will take the otherside through the bid offer spread, very small ultra liquid

Many of trillions the biggest market in the world

Interest to increase the other expeects the interest rate to decrease

Recieve fixed get a fixed a coupon over the life of the swap and you pay floating, expect interest rates fall

You gain the mark to market on the swap is positive

If you expect interest rates to increase to pay fix and recieve floating you now pay the difference, that has a positive to you as the payer

Swap decompose
Cash flows1

NOthing else two bonds one long, one short

receiver being long a fixed rate bond
being short a floating rate  -> you pay float 

Important long short concept 
Everything you need to know 
Dervices from the long short concept
10 year bond will have duration of 8 years, in the swap market 

you receive fixed 8 year duratoin on fixed leg
floating rate will have a small durationi, cant change much in value, usually below 1 year even 3 months

Net-net duration of your swap 8 years - 3 months, 7 3/4 years is how you look at the risk
