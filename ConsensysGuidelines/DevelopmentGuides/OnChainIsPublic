Remember that on-chain data is publicÂ¶
Many applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid Vickrey auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, make sure you avoid requiring users to publish information too early. The best strategy is to use commitment schemes with separate phases: first commit using the hash of the values and in a later phase revealing the values.
