Favor pull over push for external callsÂ¶

External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. 

This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically.
