The main benefit of using Hexadecimal notation is that it allows us to write out the value of a byte in a human readable format using only two characters. Those two characters are still able to represent all 256 possible values of the byte.

Converting from Decimal to Hexadecimal
The process to convert from a decimal number into a hexadecimal number is an iterative one.

Step 1 of the process is to perform integer division and divide our decimal number by 16. This results in a quotient (above the line) and a remainder at the bottom. In this case the quotient is 2743 and the remainder is 6.

Step 2 is to convert the remainder and express it in hexadecimal notation. As 6 in decimal is also expressed as 6 in hexadecimal we have our first digit.

n the next step, we take the quotient we calculated in step 1 (2743) and work out whether it is less than 16. As it isnâ€™t, we go back and repeat steps 1 and 2 above dividing the quotient from step 1 by 16 to calculate a new quotient and new remainder.
