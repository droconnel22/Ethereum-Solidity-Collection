Fallback Function
A contract can have at most one fallback function, declared using either fallback () external [payable] or fallback (bytes calldata _input) external [payable] returns (bytes memory _output) (both without the function keyword). This function must have external visibility. A fallback function can be virtual, can override and can have modifiers.

The fallback function is executed on a call to the contract if none of the other functions match the given function signature, or if no data was supplied at all and there is no receive Ether function. The fallback function always receives data, but in order to also receive Ether it must be marked payable.

f the version with parameters is used, _input will contain the full data sent to the contract (equal to msg.data) and can return data in _output. The returned data will not be ABI-encoded. Instead it will be returned without modifications (not even padding).
