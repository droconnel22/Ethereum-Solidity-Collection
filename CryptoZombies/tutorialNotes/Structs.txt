Passing structs as arguments
You can pass a storage pointer to a struct as an argument to a private or internal function. This is useful, for example, for passing around our Zombie structs between functions.

The syntax looks like this:

function _doStuff(Zombie storage _zombie) internal {
  // do stuff with _zombie
}
This way we can pass a reference to our zombie into a function instead of passing in a zombie ID and looking it up.
