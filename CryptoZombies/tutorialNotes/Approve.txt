Chapter 7: ERC721: Approve
Now, let's implement approve.

Remember, with approve the transfer happens in 2 steps:

You, the owner, call approve and give it the _approved address of the new owner, and the _tokenId you want him to take.

The new owner calls transferFrom with the _tokenId. Next, the contract checks to make sure the new owner has been already approved, and then transfers him the token.

Because this happens in 2 function calls, we need to use the zombieApprovals data structure to store who's been approved for what in between function calls.
