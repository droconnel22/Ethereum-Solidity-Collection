    "description": "Quote from C.G. Jung, 'The Red Book.' Just as Jung was addressing the nineteenth century formalism of his teachers, a hundred years later, “Where is your measure, false measurer?” is a question for those hanging on to the sinking ship of fiat currency and centralized governance. I ask the question surrounded by symbols of the past we build upon: paintings, circuits, musical instruments, and wires, into which I fade, one more abstraction in the gallery.",
